VERSION 0.0 Goals (Proof of concept)
- Clock plugin
-- Display configured in source

- Auto-complete plugin

--- Found a method to accomplish this, but because is does not grap the ASCII char of the keys
--- the inital release will only support qwerty keyboards.
-- Display a list of words that can be created from the current prefix (using look command)
--- Done with look
-- Figure out how to grab the output of look
--- Done with popen
-- Autocomplete feature is currently capslock twice... this will change but for now :)

- Makefile
-- Should be able to automate the installation of this project.

VERSION 1.0 Goals
- Auto-complete plugin
-- Able to define a key that will complete the word.
-- Possibly rank words based on use.  (will require a rewrite of the look command)

- XML parser for themes

- obHUD to manage launch of plugins
- Clock plugin
-- Add reminder
-- Change colors when nearing events

- Add reminders / color change when nearing events to clock
